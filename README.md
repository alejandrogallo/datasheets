# Common datasheets library #

This is a library for the program [papis](http://github.com/alejandrogallo/papis).
If you have `papis` installed you can take a look at the library by cloning it

```
git clone https://github.com/alejandrogallo/datasheets
```

and then checking out its contests, possibly by using the `urwid` papis gui
for instance

```
papis --lib datasheets gui --urwid
```
